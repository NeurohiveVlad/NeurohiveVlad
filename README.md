- 👋 Hi, I’m @NeurohiveVlad or Vladislav in real live.
I am friendly to people and I like to communicate with people and share with them what I know myself and learn something new from people.
If you have questions for me or my work, my telegram is open for sending messages and you can ask questions there.
I understand Russian/English/Ukrainian well both as a text and as a spoken language.
- 👀 I’m interested in web/iOS/MacOS/Robotics technologies mainly 
* for the purpose of creating their products 
* for sale current users 
* for children's education 
* for promotion of the ideas of reuse of equipment in robotics.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning HTML/CSS , iOS develop , sometimes use AutoIT for personal tasks.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on in promoting the idea of using smartphones as a control unit for educational robots. 
I have a rather global dream, albeit a little naive - I would like Android and Apple smartphones to be used as a computing unit, battery, and status screen for projects that currently use arduino. 
It's no secret that old smartphones are not very expensive. A lot of them. And many of them are still in good condition (except for the battery of course). 
They have modest power and computing capabilities compared to today's smartphones. But they have just a huge resource in comparison with arduino. 
- My dream is software for phones and a special gadget that can be connected to the port of a smartphone, with many output contacts, like an arduino, which will allow using a phone to create: a robot / automatic greenhouse / mini-constructor for a child for a small price that will not it's a pity to lose, on which you can experiment as much as you like and as you like.
